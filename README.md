## 💼 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### "Tell me about your portfolio"

> "I built a premium portfolio with a focus on design excellence and modern web standards. It features a red and dark theme inspired by platforms like Physics Wallah, smooth animations using CSS transitions, and a dark/light mode toggle powered by CSS custom properties. The entire site is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with zero dependencies, ensuring fast performance and demonstrating my understanding of core web technologies."

### "What technologies did you use?"

> "Vanilla HTML5 for semantic structure, modern CSS3 with custom properties and animations, and ES6+ JavaScript with APIs like Intersection Observer and localStorage. I focused on demonstrating core competencies rather than using frameworks - it shows I understand the foundations and can work at any level."

### "How did you optimize for performance?"

> "The entire site is only 28KB including all CSS and JavaScript. I used CSS transforms for GPU-accelerated animations, Intersection Observer API for efficient scroll detection, and avoided any external dependencies. This results in extremely fast load times and smooth 60fps interactions."

### "How is it optimized for accessibility?"

> "I implemented full keyboard navigation, semantic HTML throughout, ARIA labels on forms, visible focus states on all interactive elements, proper color contrast (WCAG AA compliant), and support for prefers-reduced-motion. Every user, regardless of ability, can access and enjoy the site."
