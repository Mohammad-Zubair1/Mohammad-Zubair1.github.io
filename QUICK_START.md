## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about your portfolio design"

> "I built a premium, Physics Wallah-inspired portfolio using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a red and dark theme, smooth micro-animations using CSS transitions, and a dark/light mode toggle powered by CSS custom properties. The design is fully responsive and optimized for mobile."

### "What's unique about your implementation?"

> "No external dependencies - everything is vanilla JavaScript and CSS. I used Intersection Observer API for efficient scroll animations, localStorage for persistent theme preference, and modern CSS like backdrop-filter for the sticky navbar. Performance is optimized: ~28KB total size."

### "How did you handle accessibility?"

> "Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels on form inputs, semantic HTML throughout, visible focus states, and support for prefers-reduced-motion. All buttons and links have clear states, and form inputs have proper labels and validation feedback."

### "Tell me about the dark mode implementation"

> "I used CSS custom properties to create a theme system. When the user toggles dark/light mode, we update the data-theme attribute on the root element, and all CSS variables automatically update. The preference persists using localStorage, so it's remembered across sessions."

### "How would you scale this to a React app?"

> "The CSS and animations are completely framework-agnostic. I'd convert the HTML structure to React components, but all the styling would remain the same. The theme system could be managed with Context API or Zustand. The performance would actually improve because React would handle re-renders efficiently."
