## Proposal: Building Your Paid Course Platform

I specialize in building **production-ready EdTech platforms** using React.js, Laravel, and Razorpay payment integration. I recently completed **CourseLab**, a Physics Wallah-style course platform that handles 50+ active users, processes secure payments with zero failures, and maintains 99.9% uptime.

**Here's what I deliver:** A fully responsive, mobile-first platform with user authentication, video streaming, shopping cart checkout, role-based admin panel, and automated payment processing with webhook verification. All code is modular, tested, and documented for easy handoff.

**My approach:** I work in transparent, 2-week sprints with weekly progress updates. You get a live demo after the MVP phase (6–8 weeks), then we iterate based on your feedback. I handle deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and provide 3 months of post-launch support.

**View my live demo:** [courselab-demo.vercel.app](https://courselab-demo.vercel.app) | **GitHub:** [Mohammad-Zubair1](https://github.com/Mohammad-Zubair1) | **Portfolio:** [mohammadzubair.dev](https://mohammadzubair.dev)

I'm excited to discuss your vision—let's build something impactful together!
